/**
 * Event payloads. RecordModels = write shape; SubscribeModels = read shape.
 *
 * ShimmieStack uses these two maps for type safety: recordEvent() checks the
 * payload against RecordModels[eventName], and subscribe() types the handler
 * against SubscribeModels[eventName].
 *
 * They are identical today. They diverge once old event versions exist in the
 * log: SubscribeModels handlers must cope with every historical shape
 * (e.g. `BookingConfirmedEventV1 | BookingConfirmedEventV2`), while
 * RecordModels only ever writes the latest shape.
